Chronos (Orbital 2024 Project)

Proposed level: Apollo

Problem Motivation:
In today’s educational environment, students are required to manage an extensive array of academic tasks, daily activities, and personal finances. Although there are numerous time and expenditure management applications available, they often feature complex functionalities that are not tailored to the specific needs of students. These applications typically operate independently, forcing students to toggle between multiple apps, which not only complicates the process but can also impact their time management and focus. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive platform that integrates essential functions for daily student life, providing a one-stop solution to optimize their campus experience.

Firstly, the daily schedules of students are often complicated by the heavy and diverse academic workload. From coursework deadlines to final exams, students need to manage their time and resources effectively. Most existing applications offer only basic scheduling functionalities and lack support for specific student needs such as segmented study times (e.g., using the Pomodoro Technique) or intense revision schedules during examination periods. Additionally, as students balance academic activities with personal and social engagements, scheduling tools must offer greater flexibility and customization.

Secondly, the distractions of the digital age, such as social media, video games, and online videos, frequently disrupt students’ study processes, affecting their learning efficiency and concentration. Although some apps provide a "Do Not Disturb" mode, these features are often too simplistic and do not meet the specific needs of students across different study phases and types of academic tasks.

Furthermore, financial management is a significant challenge in students’ daily lives. Students often need to make sensible financial decisions within a limited budget, but existing financial management apps are not intuitive and lack customization for student spending patterns. This necessitates a tool that simplifies the financial recording process and provides clear analytics, helping students better control and plan their expenditures.

In summary, we propose the development of the "Chronos" platform, a student-designed application aimed at resolving the aforementioned issues by integrating key functions—such as highly customizable schedule planning, a toggleable focus mode, and intuitive income and expenditure management. Through this platform, students can more effectively plan and manage their academic and daily lives, enhance time efficiency, reduce unnecessary mental strain, and thus achieve a balanced academic and personal life.
